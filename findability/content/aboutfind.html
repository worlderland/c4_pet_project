	<h2>About this mini-website</h2>
	<p>This website was initially built with the minimum findability strategies as in semester one we did not have an high findability knowledge.<br />
	<br />In the second semester I have improved this site following the Findability Best Practises listed <a href="seo.php" class="parag-link" target="blank">HERE</a>.<br />
	<br />By following those easy steps and correcting the code and content I found a huge improvement in my website findabilty and search engine rating.</p>
