<p>Greetings to my fellow travellers &amp; dreamers!<br />
	<br />I initially would like to apologise for any grammar or misspelling mistakes; English is not my native language and I'm really trying my best here!<br />
	<br />I would also like to say sorry to my fellow Italian citizens, brutally forced to read English... Forgive me! <br />
	However, please stay with me, because as soon as my web design skills will improve, I will enable multiple languages, including Italian. I swear!<br />
	<br />I don't know what reason led you here, but whatever that is, it means we might be more similar than you actually think.<br />
	<br />Please let me quickly tell you my story...<br />
</p>
<p>
	<br />I was born and raised in a tiny village at the bottom of the western Italian Alps, called Baldissero d'Alba.<br />
	This charming little village was built on the top of a hill in the middle of the "Roero", an extensive wine production area which along with the more famous "Langhe" has recently become part of the UNESCO heritage.<br />

	Although it might look like a lovely place to live in, ever since my early 20s I felt a little bit trapped; my daily routine was boring and the future did not look as bright as I was wishing.<br />
	At that time I was working as an automation software programmer for a medium-size company not far from home, and I was flying on regular bases almost in every corner of the World.<br />
	You might be thinking... "LUCKY YOU!..."<br />
	I know, right... How many 20 years old with a great full-time and well paid job that makes you travel the world are there out there?<br />
	Well... Despite this enviable luck, I didn't feel so special and I wasn't entirely happy.<br />
	Don't get me wrong... I loved my job and I am still grateful to my company because they basically introduced me to what has become my biggest passion: travel.<br />
	<br />However, in my opinion, a full-time, well paid job for a youngster is just the first step on the life path that society imposes nowadays; job, partner, marriage, house, kids... (not necessarily in that order).<br />
	I certainly couldn't fit in such a stereotype and that's why I started to look around...<br />
</p>
<p>	
	<br />The kick to change my life hit me when my company sent me to Australia for a job in Melbourne; I quickly took the opportunity to ask my manager if I could have my flight anticipated by a week and diverted to Sydney and have a week of holiday to enjoy it.<br />
	She agreed, making me the happiest boy on Earth...<br />
	Long story short, I went to Sydney and Melbourne, fell in love with Australia, its people, lifestyle and multicultural heritage and decided to move there a year later.<br />
	<br />This had been the best decision I've ever made so far...<br />

	I consider the first Working Holiday Visa the best year of my life and, if you are not Australian, you are between 18 and 30 yo and from an eligible country, I definitely encourage you to do it! It's a "once in a lifetime" opportunity! (<a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1/417-" target="_blank" class="parag-link">CLICK HERE </a>to know more and apply)<br /> 
	During this year I lived mostly in Adelaide and South Australia, where for 5 months I experienced the regional work due to be eligible for a second WHV. I've met amazing people from all around the globe, strangers who are part of the most precious memories I store deep inside, like playing guitar and singing around a fire on the beach, or playing cards and talking about experiences in a hostel you just got in and that you might leave the day after; others I'm still in touch with and that I hope to see again in the world somewhere very soon!<br />

	As you know, time flies when you are having fun!<br />
	A year was already over and it was time to go back home to visit friends and relatives... TRAVEL TIME!<br />
	So on the way to Italy I travelled for almost 2 months, initially across <a href="australia.php" target="_blank" class="parag-link">Australia</a>, then across Thailand and last a stop over in Dubai. I ended up at home just in time for my birthday.<br />
	The sensation I had initially after getting back from living abroad for more than 12 months was awful; it literally felt like I closed my eyes for few seconds. Nothing had changed. Apart for me.<br />
	I quickly bought another flight, deciding to try my luck in Perth, Western Australia's capital city, famous for its great climate.<br />
	<br />And guess what... I've never been so lucky!<br />
	<br />In Perth, I found great friends and a great job in a small company I wouldn't even call as such, a family perhaps... My Australian family.<br />
	They not only employed me; they actually supported me with a sponsorship, helping to achieve what was granted just few months later: a Permanent Visa.<br />
	<br />The cherry on my Australian adventure arrived few months ago, as I became an Australian Citizen.<br />

<p>
	Today I'm still working for my "Australian family", building the foundation to realise a dream I've got in my bedside drawer... Travel the World while working off a laptop<br />
	<br />This website was born as an idea of a place where I could store all of (or at least most of) my travel memories.<br />
	It actually came to life during the "Web Design" class I'm following, as an assessment project. I hope you enjoy it as I literally built it myself from scratches.<br />
	<br />I would like to conclude with one of the best memories Australia has given me: there was a frame in a flat in lived in with a sentence I've tattoed in my heart: "the biggest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do..." .<br />
	<br />And remember, IF YOU DREAM BIG ENOUGH, ANYTHING CAN BECOME TRUE...
