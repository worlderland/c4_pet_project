<p>G'day fellow travellers! <br />
	Today I would like to talk about something that has literally revolutionized the way we travel and that of course millennials, backpackers and travellers of any kind are loving: <a class="parag-link" href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/c/alessandroc2289" target="_blank">AirBnb</a><br />
	<br />AirBnB is a creative company who has basically created a worldwide accommodation community: they allowed normal people like me and you, with extra rooms at their places, or extra properties, to actually rent them out as holiday accommodations, and vice-versa, travellers like us to experience their holiday in a different way, by living with or being in touch with a local.<br />
	Once the holiday is over, both host and guest will be asked to review and star each other; poor hosting and rude guests will gain very low ratings, making it very difficult to host and book again; generally nobody books a 1 starred accommodation and on the other side, hosts have the power to refuse your booking just by looking at your stars rating and reviews.<br /> 
	<br />What you probably didn't know is that being a social network based service, <a class="parag-link" href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/c/alessandroc2289" target="_blank">AirBnb</a> has an affiliate referral program that works through the sharing of a sign-up link; let me explain in simpler words:<br />
	<br />
</p>
<h3>Friends travellers referral program</h3>

	<figcaption class="pic-capt txt-center">"My AirBnB traveller sign-up link sharing page."</figcaption>

<p>
	Every AirBnB traveller customer has a page like mine (above), that is accessible by either clicking on the tab "Credits" or on the profile picture (top-right of your screen) and then "Invite a friend";<br />
	What you'll find is your unique advertising link, that you shall use to invite friends into the AirBnB program.<br />
	Here there is mine: <a class="parag-link" href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/c/alessandroc2289" target="_blank">www.airbnb.com.au/c/alessandroc2289</a>.<br />
	Through their cookies AirBnB will know that you are the person who referred a new customer and therefore they will reward you with AirBnB credits once your referred friend/person has booked and enjoyed his/her holiday.<br />
	Remember that there is a limit or credits you can acculmulate, which is specified in AirBnB's terms &amp; conditions.<br />
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	On the other end, as mentioned above, you could also refer a <a class="parag-link" href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/r/alessandroc2289" target="_blank">Host</a>:<br />
	<br />
</p>	 
<h3>Friends hosts referral program</h3>

	<figcaption class="pic-capt txt-center">"My AirBnB host sign-up link sharing page."</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	As an AirBnB customer you can also refer friends/people to becoma a host; you will be able to access to your host referral link page by clicking on the profile picture (top-right of your screen) and then <a class="parag-link" href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/r/alessandroc2289" target="_blank">"Refer Hosts"</a>.<br />
	This program works pretty much in the same way as the traveller program and will the AirBnB credit rewards.<br />
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, I can say again that AirBnB is probably my best way to book accommodation while traveling around the world, as I really enjoy meeting and talking to locals; real people with real stories, which they will certainly share with you, making you a little bit richer day by day.<br />
	<br />I hope this article helped you clearing up your mind...<br />
	<br />Enjoy AirBnB!
